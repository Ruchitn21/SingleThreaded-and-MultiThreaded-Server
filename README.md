<h1>Single-Threaded and Multi-Threaded Server</h1>
A comprehensive comparison and implementation of single-threaded and multi-threaded server architectures, demonstrating the performance differences and use cases for each approach.
<h2>ðŸš€ Overview</h2>
This project showcases two fundamental server architectures:

<b>Single-Threaded Server:</b> Processes one client request at a time in a sequential manner
Multi-Threaded Server: Handles multiple client requests concurrently using threading
