#Single-Threaded and Multi-Threaded Server
A comprehensive comparison and implementation of single-threaded and multi-threaded server architectures, demonstrating the performance differences and use cases for each approach.
ðŸš€ Overview
This project showcases two fundamental server architectures:

Single-Threaded Server: Processes one client request at a time in a sequential manner
Multi-Threaded Server: Handles multiple client requests concurrently using threading
